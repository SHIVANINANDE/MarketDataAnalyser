# Stock Market Data Analysis
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project related to Exploratory data analysis(
EDA), Data visualization and Predictive analysis using data, provided by The Investors Exchange (IEX). I looked at real-time financial data from the stock market. I have used **Python** programming language to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I have also used statistical method called Monte Carlo Method to predict future stock prices.

## Dataset Description

- **Date**: The date set by the company on which the investor must own shares.
- **Open**: The price at which trading begins for the day.
- **High**: The highest price at which a stock is traded during the specified period.
- **Low**: The lowest price of a stock during the specified period.
- **Close**: The price of an individual stock when the stock exchange closes for the day.
- **Adj Close**: The adjusted closing price that accounts for dividends and stock splits.
- **Volume**: An indicator of liquidity, representing the total number of shares traded during the specified period.
